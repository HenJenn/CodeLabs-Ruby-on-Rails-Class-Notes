# Introduction and Setup

## Introduction 
The Back End portion of Code Labs will be similiar to the Front End in regards to structure and style. Students are expected to learn outside of class and apply that knowledge inside of class ([Flipped Class Room Model](https://omerad.msu.edu/teaching/teaching-skills-strategies/27-teaching/162-what-why-and-how-to-implement-a-flipped-classroom-model)). 

Class notes will be posted for students to use as a resource. Keep in mind these class notes are maintained. If something comes ambiguous or needs an update, please contact your code coach for adjustment. 

**Ruby on Rails** 
According to the official [Ruby on Rails docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html),
"Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails."

Ruby on Rails is a framework that allows us to build full stack web applications and RESTful APIs easily!  

## Setup

**IDEs**<br>
There are various of IDEs that you can use such as VS Code, Atom, Sublime and more. In this specific course, we like to use VS Code because of the live share extension. This helps for pair programming in a remote setting.

For now, we will be using [Repl](https://replit.com/). An online IDE that allows you to execute/compile ruby(and other various of programming languages: JavaScript, Python, C++, and more).

## Course Structure 
The span of this course be will be 20 weeks. We will go over the following: 

- Introduction and Setup
- The Ruby Programming Langauge
- Introduction to Ruby on Rails + Setup
- CRUD Operations in Rails
- Styling in Rails
- Associations & Authentication Systems
- Many-to-many Associations & Automated Testing
- Course Project
- Rails API
- Employer Project 

### Next Section - The Ruby Programming Language
- Before diving deep into rails, we have to first establish a good foundation of the ruby programming language. In these next couple of weeks, we will focus on doing just that.
