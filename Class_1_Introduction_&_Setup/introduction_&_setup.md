# Introduction and Setup

## Introduction 
The Back End portion of Code Labs will be similiar to the Front End in regards to structure and style. Students are expected to learn outside of class and apply that knowledge inside of class ([Flipped Class Room Model](https://omerad.msu.edu/teaching/teaching-skills-strategies/27-teaching/162-what-why-and-how-to-implement-a-flipped-classroom-model)). You will be asked to read documentation, watch assigned videos, complete exercises and build projects as well as commit your code to GitHub. Building Projects are our main focus here at Code Labs as it challenges you to think.  

Class notes will be posted for students to use as a resource in the Code Labs portal. Keep in mind these class notes are maintained. If something comes ambiguous or needs an update, please contact your code coach for adjustment or clarification. 

## The Back End Roadmap

In the Back End, we will go over Ruby and Ruby on Rails (Rails for short). Rails is a web framework running on the ruby programming language. Rails allows us to build full stack web applications and RESTful APIs fast and easily!  

By the end of this course, you will know how to create a full stack Ruby on Rails application and be able to connect a Rails API to Front End Applications. We will do things we weren't able to do before in the Front End such as: 
- store data in an sql database 
- create our very own API 
- use Bcrypt to create an authentication system 
- create an MVC 
- cookies
- explore features such as emailing users, real time communication, role management systems and more. 

### Course Structure 
The span of this course will be 20 weeks. We will go over the following: 
- The Ruby Programming Langauge
- Introduction to Ruby on Rails + Setup
- CRUD Operations in Rails
- Styling in Rails
- Associations & Authentication Systems
- Many-to-many Associations & Automated Testing
- Course Project
- Rails API
- Employer Project 

#### The Ruby Programming Language
Classes 2 - 5 will be spent learning the ruby programming language. It's important to understand the basic syntax and fundamentals of ruby in order to move forward onto Rails. The reason for that is the ability to debug faster and recognize common uses of Ruby into Rails. Without the basics of Ruby, it'll be difficult to differentiate between what is Rails and what is Ruby. 

Living coding sessions will be spent creating a ruby gem and building out a command line interface or CLI for short. In class will involve exercises. We will cover the following ruby fundamentals:
- syntax 
- data types
- printing to the console
- Irb
- Conditionals
- Loops and iterations
- Classes and Object Oriented Programming 

#### Introduction to Ruby on Rails + Setup
In this section, students will have installed Rails and understand the core concept of Ruby on Rails. 

#### CRUD Operations in Rails 
Create, Read, Update, Delete or CRUD operations involve a specific process in which a user interacts with the application. For example, the user can let's say, `create` a post in an application. The user can see or `read` the post they created in perhaps their homepage. The user can `update` the post. The user can also `delete` the post. CRUD operations is a standard convention commonly used in web development. 

#### Styling in Rails
In the course videos provided, it's important to note that Bootstrap 4 will be used. Since the release of [Bootstrap 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)#:~:text=Bootstrap%205%20was%20officially%20released,in%20favor%20of%20vanilla%20JavaScript), these notes will be based on Bootstrap 5.

#### Associations & Authentication Systems


## Setup

**IDEs**<br>
There are various of IDEs that you can use such as VS Code, Atom, Sublime and more. In this specific course, we like to use VS Code because of the live share extension. This helps for pair programming in a remote setting.


### Next Section - The Ruby Programming Language
- Before diving deep into rails, we have to first establish a good foundation of the ruby programming language. In these next couple of weeks, we will focus on doing just that.
